# TODO - Vibe Blog

## Next Steps - IMMEDIATE

### Design System Scaling Adjustment
- [ ] **SCALE UP: Current design is 10% too small (0.9x scale applied globally)**
- [ ] Files that need scaling adjustment:
  - `/src/styles/tokens.css` - All rem values, spacing scale
  - `/src/components/PageHeader.astro` - Hardcoded rem values (0.54rem â†’ larger)
  - `/src/components/Header.astro` - Nav text sizes
  - `/src/components/Footer.astro` - Newsletter and footer text
  - `/src/components/Tag.astro` - Tag font sizes
  - `/src/pages/index.astro` - Post grid spacing, dates
  - `/src/pages/posts/[slug].astro` - Article typography, code blocks
  - `/src/pages/zero-to-ship.astro` - Module numbers, all hardcoded values
  - `/src/pages/tags/[tag].astro` and `/src/pages/tags/index.astro` - List layouts
- [ ] Consider: Scale up by 5-7% (multiply current values by 1.05-1.07) for better readability
- [ ] Code blocks currently at 0.7rem - consider 0.75-0.8rem

### Module 4: Ship & Iterate (needs 4 articles)
- [ ] See CONTENT-BACKLOG.md for article ideas when ready to write

### Newsletter Setup
- [x] Set up Buttondown account and get embed code
- [x] Replace placeholder in subscribe.astro with actual Buttondown form
- [x] Test newsletter signup flow - WORKING!
- [ ] Add newsletter CTA to About page

### Design Polish
- [x] **Style code blocks and inline code properly** - Code blocks now at 0.7rem with proper bold weight
- [ ] **Add context-label styling** - Black bg, white text, sans-serif caps (0.54rem, 0.27em spacing after scaling)
- [ ] Review and improve mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Add subtle animations/transitions

## SEO & Analytics
