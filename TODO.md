# TODO - Vibe Blog

## Next Steps

- [ ] Set up Buttondown account and get embed code
- [ ] Replace placeholder in subscribe.astro with actual Buttondown form
- [ ] Choose domain name for the blog
- [ ] Update astro.config.mjs with chosen domain
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel (connect GitHub repo)
- [ ] Set up Google Search Console for new domain
- [ ] Write first real blog post
- [ ] Test newsletter signup flow

## Content & Design Improvements

- [ ] Determine actual content structure/types (move away from rigid 6-part format)
- [ ] Figure out article types/categories that make sense for the journey
- [ ] Automate content organization and guide creation from tags
- [ ] Review and revise design system to be distinct from FR (good starting point but needs own identity)
- [ ] Update typography, colors, spacing to have unique vibe-blog aesthetic

## Future Features (Phase 2+)

- [ ] "Buy me coffee" donation button
- [ ] Tag-based guide collections (auto-generate from existing posts)
- [ ] RSS feed for posts
- [ ] Simple analytics (Vercel Analytics)
- [ ] Premium content for supporters (when audience grows)

## Completed

- [x] Initial Astro project setup with content collections
- [x] Editorial design system (tokens, typography, spacing)
- [x] Core components (Layout, Header, Footer, PostPreview)
- [x] All pages (index, archive, about, subscribe, individual posts)
- [x] Sample post with 6-part structure template
- [x] GitHub repository creation and initial commit
- [x] Local development environment working

## Notes

- Site currently running at http://localhost:4322/

- All design uses tokens - no hardcoded values
- Ready for domain setup and Vercel deployment
- Buttondown placeholder on subscribe page needs real embed code
