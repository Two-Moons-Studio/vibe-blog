## For Future Sessions

When starting a new session, AI assistants should:
1. Read `PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md` for quick context
2. Check `CLAUDE.md` for instructions and workflows
3. Reference `CONTENT-GUIDE.md` for any content creation
4. Check `TODO.md` for current priorities
5. Look at `CONTENT-BACKLOG.md` when ready to write articles
