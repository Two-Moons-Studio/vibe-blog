# Content Guide - Vibe Code Moonlighter

*Comprehensive guide for content strategy, voice, and the Zero to Ship learning path*

## 1. Project Positioning & Audience

### Who I Am
- **Background**: Design Director (10+ years) → Product Director → Vibe Coder
- **Current**: Product leader who moonlights as a builder
- **Perspective**: Non-dev learning to code with AI assistance
- **Important**: I was a design director before product director - 10+ years in design industry, now lead product teams

### What This Is
- Bite-sized tips and learnings from the journey
- Real fumbling from someone without dev background
- Bridge for product/design folks into coding
- "It's OK to be dumb" energy throughout
- Documentation of the journey while it's fresh

### What This Isn't
- Dev tutorials for developers
- Course or template selling
- Guru positioning
- Perfect, polished content
- Another "learn to code" bootcamp

### Target Audience

**Primary:**
1. **Product people** - Who write strat docs but want to build
2. **Design folks** - Who want to make real things, not just mockups
3. **Non-technical professionals** - Intimidated but curious about coding

**NOT My Audience:**
- Course junkies
- ML/CS nerds
- Active professional developers
- People looking for the next shiny thing

### Approach
- Assume zero knowledge baseline
- Quick "skip if you know HTML/CSS" signals where relevant
- Focus on prod/design perspectives they already have

## 2. Content Pillars & Themes

### The 6 Content Pillars

#### 1. Getting Unstuck
- Terminal terror, setup struggles
- Permission errors, environment issues
- The basics that block everyone

#### 2. AI That Actually Helps
- Making Claude useful vs agreeable
- Anti-yes-bot techniques
- Two-tool workflows
- Getting unstuck with AI

#### 3. Product POV
- PM perspective on building
- Strategy docs → working features
- "This is better than writing a PRD" moments
- Product thinking applied to code

#### 4. Design That Ships
- Designer perspective on building real things
- Design systems that build themselves
- From mockups to production
- Visual thinking in code

#### 5. Dev Decoded
- Translation for the rest of us
- Dev concepts in plain language
- Mental models that click
- Making sense of developer world

#### 6. Reality Checks
- What broke and why
- Honest time/sanity costs
- "This took 3 hours not 3 minutes"
- The fumbles along the way

### Running Themes
- **Ship messy, iterate live** - Get to production even if imperfect
- It's OK to be lost/confused
- Small wins matter
- Breaking things > following tutorials
- User empathy > technical perfection
- Learning through doing, not planning forever
- But still making real things people can use (not just experiments)

## 3. Voice & Writing Guidelines

### The Chef Claude Metaphor (CRITICAL TO MAINTAIN)

**The Setup:**
Claude is a professional chef who actually knows how to cook everything. You're someone who wants to make dinner but maybe has only made cereal before. You're not asking Claude to teach you to be a chef – you just want dinner on the table tonight.

**Why This Works:**
- **Removes intimidation** – You wouldn't feel dumb asking a chef which knife to use
- **Sets realistic expectations** – You're not becoming a chef, you're making dinner
- **Leverages expertise** – The chef handles the complex parts
- **Focuses on outcomes** – Dinner on the table, not culinary theory

**Use This Framing When:**
- Introducing AI-assisted development
- Explaining why PMs/designers can build now
- Describing the collaborative relationship with Claude

### Voice & Tone

**Write Like This:**
- Straightforward, no BS
- Cooking/music/life metaphors (less gaming)
- Wit without cringe
- Assuring people it's OK to not know
- Like explaining to a friend
- Slightly messy is better than marketing polish

**Avoid "Claude Voice" (CRITICAL):**
When writing articles or copy, avoid these patterns:
- Punchy marketing language ("This is different. PERIOD.")
- Repetitive structure ("No X. No Y. No Z.")
- Overly dramatic declarations
- Too many short sentences in a row
- Perfect parallel construction everywhere
- "Let's dive in" or "Let's break this down" openings
- Excessive use of "game-changer" type language

**BAD Example (Claude Voice):**
"Vibe coding is different. It's not about perfection. It's not about knowing everything. It's not about following rules. It's about shipping. PERIOD. No gatekeeping. No prerequisites. No BS. Just build."

**GOOD Example (Natural Voice):**
"Look, vibe coding is basically using AI to build stuff when you don't know how to code. You're not trying to become a developer – you just want your idea to exist. The PM in you already knows what to build, now Claude helps you actually build it."

### Article Title Guidelines
- No formulas: Avoid "The X That Y", "How to Z", "Why You Should"
- Say what happened: "Claude forgets everything like Majora's Mask"
- Stay conversational: Write it like you'd text a friend
- Mix metaphors: Cooking, music, life stuff - not just gaming
- Substance over clever: If it sounds like LinkedIn, rewrite

**Good Titles:**
- "Terminal setup is the actual hardest part"
- "When your PRD takes longer than building the thing"
- "Multi-Clauding for Claude Code"

**Bad Titles:**
- "The Ultimate Guide to Terminal Setup"
- "10 Things That Will Change How You Code"
- "Why Every PM Should Learn This One Trick"

### Context Labels (Technical Formatting)
For inline context within articles:
- Black background, white text
- Sans-serif, uppercase
- 0.6rem font size
- 0.3em letter spacing
- Used for: file paths, technical context, system states

Example: `<context>DEVELOPMENT MODE</context>`

## 4. Zero to Ship Learning Path

### Philosophy: Pasta, Not Soufflé
Learning to code with AI should be like making pasta – reliable, forgiving, improves with practice. Not like making a soufflé where one wrong move ruins everything.

### The Path Structure

**Module 1: Mechanical Foundations (Week 1)**
- Dev environment setup
- Terminal basics
- Claude setup
- Git fundamentals

**Module 2: Strategy & Planning (Week 2)**
- Product specs & planning
- Technical specs (MVP definition)
- Context engineering
- Resource planning

**Module 3: Building with Claude (Week 3)**
- Two-tool workflow (Desktop + Code)
- Context management
- Debugging with AI
- Git workflows

**Module 4: Ship & Iterate (Week 4)**
- Deployment
- User feedback
- Iteration cycles
- Building momentum

### Content Principles for Zero to Ship

**Every Article Must:**
- Take 5-10 minutes to read
- Have one clear learning outcome
- Include a "try this now" action
- Connect to the larger journey
- Feel like progress, not homework

**Bite-Sized Wins Approach:**
- Small victories build confidence
- Each lesson = immediate application
- No theory without practice
- Mistakes are features, not bugs

## 5. Article Formats & Structure

### Post Formats
Let content dictate format, not force everything into one box:

**Problem/Fumble/Fix/Reality Check** - For troubleshooting posts
- The Problem: What you faced
- The Fumble: What went wrong
- The Fix: What worked
- Reality Check: Time/sanity cost

**Narrative** - For journey/discovery posts
- Natural storytelling
- Chronological discovery
- Emotional honesty

**Technique Spotlight** - For specific methods
- Clear technique name
- When to use it
- Step-by-step approach
- Common pitfalls

**Quick Tips** - For bite-sized insights
- Single concept
- Immediate application
- No elaborate setup

### Writing Process
1. Mine learning logs for authentic experiences
2. Keep drafts 300-800 words initially
3. Include real examples, real struggles
4. Test that advice actually works
5. Edit for "Claude voice" removal

### Quality Checks
- Would I click this if I wasn't trying to grow an audience?
- Does this sound like something charity.wtf would publish?
- Am I trying too hard to be clever?
- Is this what actually happened or am I inflating it?

## 6. Distribution & Success Metrics

### Publishing Approach
- **No rigid schedule** - Post when ready
- **Build a queue** - Drip content out steadily
- **Frequency**: Every 1-2 weeks, more if on a roll
- **Launch priority**: Need content ready for personal network

### Channels
- **Blog**: Everything lives here first
- **Personal network**: Initial distribution
- **Newsletter**: TBD after content creation
- **LinkedIn**: Natural fit for product/strategy content
- **Twitter/X**: Potential for quick tips

### Success Metrics

**Primary Goals:**
- Help others gain confidence in building
- Document journey while it's fresh
- Build helpful resource for prod/design folks

**Secondary Goals:**
- Cover AI subscription/hosting costs eventually
- Build personal network/reputation
- Create reusable learning resources

**What Success Looks Like:**
- People saying "this helped me start"
- Prod/design folks feeling less intimidated
- Authentic community around learning
- Sustainable content creation rhythm

### Content Pipeline
1. Mine learning logs for authentic experiences
2. Fill gaps with research-based posts
3. Write in batches when inspired
4. Queue for steady release
5. Adapt based on what resonates
