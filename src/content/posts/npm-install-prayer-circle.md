## The Setup

Cloned a new repo. Ran npm install. Watched my terminal explode with activity.

## The Struggle

"387 vulnerabilities found." WHAT? Is my computer compromised? Should I call IT? Why are there so many warnings?

## The Solution

Learned that npm install is basically controlled chaos. Most warnings don't matter. The internet runs on faith and deprecated packages.

## The Designer Take

It's like opening someone else's Figma file and seeing 400 missing fonts. Alarming, but usually fine.

## The PM Take

Technical debt visualization. This is what "we'll fix it later" actually looks like.

## Reality Check

**Packages installed**: 47,382  
**Packages I understand**: 3  
**Times everything still worked**: Most of them  
**New mantra**: "If it builds, it ships"
