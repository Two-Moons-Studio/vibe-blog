New AI coding tool drops every Tuesday. Cursor one week, Windsurf the next, then Bolt, Continue, v0, Replit. Twitter loses its mind. "THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING!"

Meanwhile you're drowning in waitlists and YouTube comparisons, building nothing.

<span class="context-label">INDUSTRY REALITY:</span> They all use the same AI models underneath (GPT-4, Claude, etc). The differences are mostly UI and workflow preferences. Pick one, learn it deeply, ship stuff. That's what matters.

I picked Claude Code because:
- It's Claude (currently the best at coding) right in your terminal
- No new IDE to learn
- Works with any project type
- Free tier is generous enough to actually build things
- Simple. Just works.

**Getting Claude Code:**

1. Go to [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download)
2. Download the Mac version
3. Install it (drag to Applications, the usual)
4. Open Terminal and type:
```bash
claude
```

If you see a welcome message, you're in. If not, you might need to restart Terminal.

**Your first conversation:**
```bash
claude "create a simple HTML file with a heading that says hello"
```

Watch it create the file. Open it in your browser. You just shipped something.

**What about the other tools?**

- **Cursor:** It's VS Code with AI bolted on. Good if you already know VS Code. You don't.
- **Windsurf:** This week's hotness. Next week there'll be something newer.
- **Bolt:** Great for quick demos, painful for real projects.
- **Replit:** When you need instant deployment. Not yet.
- **v0:** Specialized for UI components. Too narrow for learning.

The tool doesn't matter as much as everyone pretends. What matters is picking one and getting good at it. I've built entire products with Claude Code. You can too.

**The real secret:** While everyone's debating tools, you'll be shipping. That's the actual competitive advantage.

Next: Teaching Claude about your specific project so it stops suggesting things you don't want.
