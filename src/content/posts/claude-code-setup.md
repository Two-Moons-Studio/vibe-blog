## The Setup

Every week there's a new "INSANE AI CODING TOOL CHANGES EVERYTHING ü§Ø" on Twitter. Cursor, Windsurf, Bolt, v0, Replit, Continue...

Exhausting. Here's permission to ignore all that noise and pick one.

## The Struggle

Tool FOMO is real. You spend more time evaluating tools than building. You watch 47 YouTube videos comparing them. You join waitlists. You stress about picking the "wrong" one.

Meanwhile, you've built nothing.

## The Solution

Claude Code. Done. Decision made.

Why?
- It's Claude (best AI) in your terminal
- No weird IDE to learn
- Works with any project
- Free tier is generous
- It just works

Download: [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download)

Install it. Open terminal. Type:
```bash
claude
```

If you see a welcome message, you're in.

## The Designer Take

You know how designers argue about Figma vs Sketch vs XD? It doesn't matter. What matters is picking one and getting good at it.

Claude Code is Figma - not perfect, but everyone uses it, it's constantly improving, and it gets the job done.

## The PM Take

This is tool consolidation. One AI assistant that handles everything instead of 5 different tools for different tasks. Less context switching = more shipping.

The real productivity gain isn't from having the "best" tool. It's from deeply knowing one tool.

## Reality Check

‚è±Ô∏è **Time:** 10 minutes to install  
üß† **Sanity:** High (stop the tool research)  
üí∞ **Cost:** Free tier, then $20/month  

**The truth about AI coding tools:**
- They all use the same underlying models
- They all do 90% the same stuff
- The "best" one changes monthly
- You'll rebuild everything anyway

**What you're NOT missing:**
- Cursor: It's VS Code with AI. You don't need VS Code yet.
- Windsurf: New hotness. Will be replaced by newer hotness.
- Bolt: Great for demos, rough for real projects.
- Replit: When you need deployment, not now.

**First command to try:**
```bash
claude "help me create a simple HTML file"
```

Watch it work. Feel the power.
