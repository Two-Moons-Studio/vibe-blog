Claude Code is your vibe code chef. You describe what you want, Chef Claude cooks it up. No memorizing syntax, no debugging for hours, just you and your AI chef building things together.

<span class="context-label">DEV INSIGHT:</span> <span class="context-text">There are dozens of AI coding tools. They mostly use the same AI models underneath. Claude Code gives you direct access to Claude (currently the best at coding) right in your terminal. Simple, powerful, no extra apps to learn.</span>

## INSTALLING CLAUDE CODE

Go to [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download) → download the Mac version → install it (drag to Applications)

Open iTerm2 and type:
```bash
claude
```

You should see a welcome message. If you get "command not found", restart iTerm2 and try again.

## MEETING YOUR CHEF
Try your first command:

```bash
claude "create a simple HTML file with a heading that says hello world"
```

Chef Claude will:
- Create an HTML file
- Add proper structure
- Include your heading
- Tell you exactly what it did

Find the file and open it in your browser. You just built your first thing.

## HOW CHEF CLAUDE WORKS

Think of Claude as a chef who:
- Knows every recipe (programming pattern)
- Can adapt to your taste (project needs)
- Explains what they're doing (learning opportunity)
- Never judges your questions (ask anything)

The key is being specific about what you want. "Make me a website" is like asking a chef to "make food." But "create a landing page with a hero section and email signup" gives Chef Claude a clear recipe to follow.
