## The Setup

After 12+ years as a Design Director and now Product Director, I finally got tired of hearing "technically not feasible" for perfectly reasonable ideas. So I decided to learn how to build things myselfâ€”with a lot of help from AI.

## The Struggle

Turns out, the terminal is still terrifying even when you're not 22 anymore. Who knew?

## The Solution

Start documenting everything. If I'm going to fumble through this, might as well make it useful for the next designer who decides to take the plunge.

## The Designer Take

This feels exactly like learning a new design tool, except the tool talks back and occasionally roasts your code choices.

## The PM Take

If I can ship functional products in 48 hours instead of 48 days waiting for dev resources, that changes everything about how we build.

## Reality Check

**Time**: 2 hours to set up this blog  
**Cost**: $0 (so far)  
**Sanity**: 8/10 (surprisingly therapeutic)

*This is what you can expect: honest takes, zero BS, and probably some embarrassing code along the way. Welcome to the journey.*
