## The Setup

Everyone said "just use git." Nobody explained what git actually WAS.

## The Struggle

Add, commit, push, pull - it sounded like exercise instructions. What was actually happening to my files?

## The Solution

Git is just version history on steroids. Like Figma's version history, but for code, with better collaboration features.

## The Designer Take

Branches = exploring different design directions  
Commits = saving your work with a sticky note  
Pull requests = design review, but for code

## The PM Take

It's like track changes in Google Docs met a time machine. You can always go back, which means you can be brave going forward.

## Reality Check

**Times I was afraid to commit**: 20+  
**Times git actually lost my work**: 0  
**Confidence level now**: Committing everything
