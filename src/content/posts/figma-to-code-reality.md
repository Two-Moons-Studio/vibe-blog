## The Setup

Had a beautiful card component in Figma. Auto-layout, perfect spacing, chef's kiss. Time to code it.

## The Struggle

CSS had other plans. Flexbox? Grid? Why is everything overlapping? Why does it look perfect on my screen but broken everywhere else?

## The Solution

Learned that CSS isn't Figma. It's better in some ways (real responsiveness!) and worse in others (why is centering still hard?).

## The Designer Take

Design tools show intention. Code shows reality. The gap between them is where the real work happens.

## The PM Take

This is why devs need more time than designers think. It's not just "converting" - it's solving for infinite screen sizes.

## Reality Check

**Figma design time**: 30 minutes  
**CSS implementation**: 3 hours  
**Times I said "it works in Figma"**: 47
