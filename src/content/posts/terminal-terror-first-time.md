## The Setup

Opening Terminal for the first time. How hard could it be?

## The Struggle

Every command returned an error. PATH? What PATH? Why is everything permission denied when it's MY computer?

## The Solution

Learned that Terminal isn't angry, it's just... specific. Very, very specific.

## The Designer Take

In design tools, things just work. In Terminal, you need to tell it EXACTLY what you want, including where to find the tools to do it.

## The PM Take

It's like writing a PRD for a very literal stakeholder who will do exactly what you say, nothing more, nothing less.

## Reality Check

**Time to figure it out**: 3 hours  
**Actual terminal usage**: 5 minutes  
**Googling "how to exit vim"**: Yes, that happened
