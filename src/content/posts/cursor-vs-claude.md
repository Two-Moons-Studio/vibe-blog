## The Setup

Started with just Claude. Then discovered Cursor. Thought I had to choose. I was wrong.

## The Struggle

Cursor was amazing at autocomplete but terrible at strategy. Claude was great at architecture but couldn't see my files easily.

## The Solution

Use both. Cursor for the fingers, Claude for the brain. They're different tools for different jobs.

## The Designer Take

It's like using Figma for design and FigJam for thinking. Same company, different purposes, better together.

## The PM Take

Right tool, right job. Don't force one tool to do everything. Your workflow will thank you.

## Reality Check

**Money spent on AI tools**: $50/month  
**Time saved**: 10+ hours/week  
**Worth it?**: Every penny
