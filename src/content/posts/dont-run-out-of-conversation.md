You're building momentum. Claude's cranking out code. Then suddenly Claude says "I'm having trouble remembering our earlier conversation" or starts suggesting things you already rejected. You've hit the context limit.

## WHAT "CONTEXT" ACTUALLY MEANS

Think of context as Claude's working memory. Like your laptop's RAM, not its hard drive. Every message, every piece of code, every file Claude reads - it all sits in this temporary memory.

When it fills up:
- Claude forgets earlier messages
- Suggestions become generic
- It starts repeating work
- Quality drops dramatically

<span class="context-label">THE BUDGET</span> <span class="context-text">You get roughly 200K tokens per conversation. That's about 150,000 words. Sounds like a lot until you realize every file Claude reads and writes counts against it.</span>

## THE /CONTEXT COMMAND

Want to see what Claude remembers? Type:

```
/context
```

You'll see:
- Token count used
- What percentage is left
- Recent messages
- Files in memory

When you hit 70%, start thinking about wrapping up. At 90%, you're in danger zone.

## /COMPACT: YOUR RESET BUTTON

When context gets full, use:

```
/compact
```

This:
- Summarizes the conversation
- Clears old messages
- Keeps recent context
- Gives you breathing room

But you lose detail. Claude might forget specific decisions or nuances. That's why todos and documentation matter - they survive compacting.

## BUILDING IN CHUNKS

The secret to not running out: build in focused chunks, not marathon sessions.

**Bad approach:**
"Build my entire blog from scratch"
(Burns through context in one session)

**Good approach:**
- Session 1: "Set up the project structure"
- Session 2: "Build the homepage"
- Session 3: "Add blog post functionality"
- Session 4: "Style everything"

Each session starts fresh with full context.

## RESISTING "BUILD EVERYTHING AT ONCE"

There's temptation when Claude's on a roll to keep pushing:

"Now add tags"
"Now add search"  
"Now add comments"
"Now add..."

Stop. This burns context and creates brittle code. Better to:
1. Build core functionality
2. Test it works
3. Commit and push
4. Start fresh session for next feature

<span class="context-label">HARD TRUTH</span> <span class="context-text">The last 20% of your context produces 80% of your bugs. When Claude starts forgetting things, mistakes multiply.</span>

## WHEN TO SWITCH CHEFS

Claude Code offers different models:

**Sonnet** (default):
- Fast responses
- Great for building
- Conservative with context
- Use for 90% of work

**Opus**:
- Deeper thinking
- Better at strategy
- Creative solutions
- Burns more context
- Switch for complex problems

**Haiku**:
- Lightning fast
- Minimal context usage
- Good for simple tasks
- Use for bulk updates

Switch models mid-conversation:
```
/model opus
Let's rethink this architecture...

/model sonnet  
Now let's build it...
```

## THE CHUNK WORKFLOW

Here's my actual workflow for building without context issues:

**Start of session:**
```
/context
[Check I have full context]

Read TODO.md
What's the next chunk to build?
```

**Middle of session:**
```
/context
[Check usage at 50%]

Let's finish this component and commit
```

**End of session:**
```
Push all changes
Update TODO.md with progress
[Close session before 80% context]
```

## SIGNS YOU NEED A FRESH START

Start a new session when:
- Claude suggests things you already rejected
- Code quality drops
- Responses get generic
- Claude says "I don't recall..."
- You're past 80% context

Don't try to squeeze out those last few tokens. Fresh context = fresh thinking.

## THE CONTINUITY TRICK

Before ending a session:

```
Update TODO.md with:
- What we completed
- What's in progress  
- Next priority
- Any important decisions

Then push everything.
```

Next session starts:

```
Read TODO.md and continue where we left off.
```

Zero friction restart.

<span class="context-label">CONTEXT IS CURRENCY</span> <span class="context-text">Spend it wisely. Building in chunks feels slower but actually ships faster because you avoid the context death spiral where everything breaks at once.</span>

You now know how to manage Claude's memory. Next, let's make sure what you build looks consistent.
