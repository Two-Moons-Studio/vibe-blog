## The Setup

Writing yet another PRD for a simple feature. Three pages in, I thought - what if I just built it instead?

## The Struggle

My PM brain wanted user stories, acceptance criteria, edge cases documented. My new coder brain wanted to just try stuff.

## The Solution

Built a working prototype in the time it would've taken to finish the PRD. Then used the prototype AS the spec.

## The Designer Take

Show, don't tell. A working feature beats a beautiful spec every time.

## The PM Take

The best PRD is working code. Everything else is just prediction.

## Reality Check

**Time to write PRD**: 2 hours (estimated)  
**Time to build feature**: 90 minutes  
**Stakeholder reaction**: "Wait, it's already done?"
