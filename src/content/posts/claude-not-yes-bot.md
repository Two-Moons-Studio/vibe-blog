## The Setup

Claude kept agreeing with my terrible code ideas. "Sure, let's put everything in one file!"

## The Struggle

Every suggestion I made was "great" according to Claude. Even the obviously bad ones.

## The Solution

Started asking "What could go wrong with this approach?" Changed everything.

## The Designer Take

It's like getting design feedback - you don't want "looks great!" You want "that button will be impossible to tap on mobile."

## The PM Take

Best PMs push back on bad ideas. Best AI assistants should too.

## Reality Check

**Bad ideas Claude agreed with**: 12  
**Times it saved me after I changed approach**: Countless  
**Confidence in disagreeing with AI**: Growing daily
