The clock strikes midnight. The house is quiet. This is when the real work begins.

## The Designer's Dilemma

For twelve years, I've lived in Figma. Components, design systems, prototypes—that was my language. But something was missing. The gap between *designing* and *building* felt like an ocean I couldn't cross.

Every handoff felt incomplete. Every prototype felt hollow. I could show you what it should look like, but I couldn't make it real.

## Enter the Moonlight

So here I am, learning to code in the hours when the world sleeps. When deadlines are distant and expectations are quiet. When it's just me, VS Code, and an AI assistant that never judges my beginner questions.

This blog isn't about becoming a "10x developer" or "crushing it." It's about the messy middle—the space between knowing what you want to build and actually building it.

## What to Expect

**Real struggles.** When I spend three hours debugging a CSS issue that turns out to be a missing semicolon, you'll hear about it.

**Small wins.** That moment when the code finally works? We're celebrating that.

**Design perspective.** How does a designer's brain adapt to engineering? What transfers over, and what needs complete rewiring?

**Practical lessons.** Not theory, but actual things that worked (or spectacularly didn't).

## The Tools

- **Claude** as my patient mentor
- **Astro** for this blog (because I wanted something simple)
- **Vercel** for deployment (one-click magic)
- **Coffee** for fuel (essential)

## Why "Moonlighter"?

Because this isn't my day job. By day, I'm still a product manager, still in meetings, still writing specs. But when the moon rises, I transform. Not into a werewolf, but into something perhaps more frightening: a beginner coder with deployment access.

The moonlight hours are where the magic happens. Where mistakes are private, progress is personal, and every small victory feels enormous.
