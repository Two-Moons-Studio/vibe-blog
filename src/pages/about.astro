          Hi, I'm Jess. After 10+ years as a Design Director and now as a PM leader, 
          I've always been fascinated by the gap between idea and implementation. 
          Not the fault lines between teams, but the actual mechanics of how things get built.
        </p>

        <p>
          This blog started as an experiment: Could someone who thinks in user flows and 
          wireframes learn to ship actual products? Not to replace developers (they're 
          wizards), but to understand the medium better. To prototype with more fidelity. 
          To have better conversations about what's possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          What I discovered was vibe coding - building with AI as a collaborator. It's not 
          about memorizing syntax or grinding through tutorials. It's about learning to direct, 
          to articulate vision clearly enough that Claude can help execute it.
        </p>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>
          The best PMs and designers I know have always had a hacker mentality - not in the 
          technical sense, but in the "let me just try this" sense. AI tools finally make that 
          accessible to those of us who think in systems and experiences rather than code.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every post here is a real attempt to build something, documented honestly. The wins 
          are small but real. The failures are educational. The process is messier than any 
          tutorial would admit.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you've ever opened a terminal and immediately closed it, or wondered if you're 
          "technical enough" to build your ideas - this is for you. We're all just figuring 
          it out, one vibe at a time.
