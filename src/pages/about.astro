      <div class="content">
        <p>
          A lot of people have been asking me how to get started with AI coding. The honest answer 
          is that most of the content out there isn't super helpful when you're actually starting 
          from zero. It either assumes you know what npm is, or it's trying to sell you something.
        </p>

        <p>
          So I started writing down what actually worked as I learned. Not the theory, just the 
          practical stuff. How to not be scared of the terminal. What Claude Code actually does. 
          Why my fonts keep breaking (literally happening as I write this About page with Claude).
        </p>

        <p>
          I think the best PMs and designers have always wanted to build things themselves - we 
          just didn't have the time to learn traditional coding. AI tools change that. You can 
          go from idea to working prototype in an afternoon if you know how to talk to Claude.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's what vibe coding is - learning to collaborate with AI to build real things. 
          You don't need to understand how JavaScript works. You need to understand how to 
          describe what you want clearly enough that Claude can help you build it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every post here is something I actually tried to build. Some worked great, some took 
          forever to debug, most taught me something I didn't expect to learn. It's messier than 
          a tutorial but probably more useful.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm not pretending to be an expert here - I'm literally learning as I write these posts. 
          There are probably better ways to do everything I'm showing. But sometimes you just need 
          to see someone else struggle through the same stuff to know you're not alone in finding 
          this hard at first.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you've been wanting to build something but don't know where to start, hopefully 
          this helps. We're all just figuring it out as we go.
