        <p>
          Everyone I talk to wants to try AI-assisted coding but doesn't know where to start. 
          The YouTube videos are clickbait. The Twitter threads are hype. The tutorials assume 
          you already know too much. It's all noise, no signal.
        </p>

        <p>
          This blog is different. It's the real documentation of learning to build with AI - 
          starting from actual zero. No hidden prerequisites. No "just npm install" without 
          explaining what npm is. Every struggle documented, every small win celebrated.
        </p>

        <p>
          The best PMs and designers have always had a hacker mentality - not in the 
          technical sense, but in the "let me just try this" sense. AI tools finally make that 
          accessible to those of us who think in systems and experiences rather than code.
        </p>

        <p>
          What I discovered was vibe coding - building with AI as a collaborator. It's not 
          about memorizing syntax or grinding through tutorials. It's about learning to direct, 
          to articulate vision clearly enough that Claude can help execute it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every post here is a real attempt to build something. The wins are small but real. 
          The failures are educational. The process is messier than any tutorial would admit. 
          But most importantly - it's actually followable.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you've ever opened a terminal and immediately closed it, or wondered if you're 
          "technical enough" to build your ideas - this is for you. We're figuring it out 
          together, one vibe at a time.
