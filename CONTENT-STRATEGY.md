# Vibe Blog Content Strategy

## Core Positioning

### Who I Am
- **Background**: Design Director (10+ years) → Product Director → Vibe Coder
- **Current**: Product leader who moonlights as a builder
- **Perspective**: Non-dev learning to code with AI assistance

### What This Is
- Bite-sized tips and learnings from the journey
- Real fumbling from someone without dev background
- Bridge for product/design folks into coding
- "It's OK to be dumb" energy throughout

### What This Isn't
- Dev tutorials for developers
- Course or template selling
- Guru positioning
- Perfect, polished content

## Target Audience

### Primary
1. **Product people** - Who write strat docs but want to build
2. **Design folks** - Who want to make real things, not just mockups
3. **Non-technical professionals** - Intimidated but curious about coding

### NOT My Audience
- Course junkies
- ML/CS nerds
- Active professional developers

### Approach
- Assume zero knowledge baseline
- Quick "skip if you know HTML/CSS" signals where relevant
- Focus on prod/design perspectives they already have

## Content Pillars

### 1. Getting Unstuck
- Terminal terror, setup struggles
- Permission errors, environment issues
- The basics that block everyone

### 2. AI That Actually Helps
- Making Claude useful vs agreeable
- Anti-yes-bot techniques
- Two-tool workflows
- Getting unstuck with AI

### 3. Product POV
- PM perspective on building
- Strategy docs → working features
- "This is better than writing a PRD" moments
- Product thinking applied to code

### 4. Design That Ships
- Designer perspective on building real things
- Design systems that build themselves
- From mockups to production
- Visual thinking in code

### 5. Dev Decoded
- Translation for the rest of us
- Dev concepts in plain language
- Mental models that click
- Making sense of developer world

### 6. Reality Checks
- What broke and why
- Honest time/sanity costs
- "This took 3 hours not 3 minutes"
- The fumbles along the way

## Themes & Voice

### Running Themes
- **Ship messy, iterate live** - Get to production even if imperfect
- It's OK to be lost/confused
- Small wins matter
- Breaking things > following tutorials
- User empathy > technical perfection

### Voice & Tone
- Straightforward, no BS
- Cooking/music/life metaphors (less gaming)
- Wit without cringe
- Assuring people it's OK to not know

### Post Formats
Let content dictate format:
- **Problem/Fumble/Fix/Reality Check** - For troubleshooting posts
- **Narrative** - For journey/discovery posts
- **Technique spotlight** - For specific methods
- **Quick tips** - For bite-sized insights

## Distribution Strategy

### Publishing Approach
- **No rigid schedule** - Post when ready
- **Build a queue** - Drip content out steadily
- **Frequency**: Every 1-2 weeks, more if on a roll
- **Launch priority**: Need content ready for personal network

### Channels
- **Blog**: Everything lives here first
- **Personal network**: Initial distribution
- **Newsletter**: TBD after content creation
- **LinkedIn**: Natural fit for product/strategy content
- **Twitter/X**: Potential for quick tips

## Content Pipeline

### Creation Process
1. Mine learning logs for authentic experiences
2. Fill gaps with research-based posts
3. Write in batches when inspired
4. Queue for steady release
5. Adapt based on what resonates

### Quality Bar
- Real experiences only
- Helpful without being preachy
- Product-ready examples (not just experiments)
- Honest about time/difficulty

## Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
- Help others gain confidence in building
- Document journey while it's fresh
- Build helpful resource for prod/design folks

### Secondary Goals
- Cover AI subscription/hosting costs eventually
- Build personal network/reputation
- Create reusable learning resources

### What Success Looks Like
- People saying "this helped me start"
- Prod/design folks feeling less intimidated
- Authentic community around learning

## Next Steps

1. Review and select initial 10-15 posts from content list
2. Draft first 3-5 posts for launch
3. Ensure Zero to Ship page has enough content
4. Soft launch to personal network
5. Iterate based on feedback
