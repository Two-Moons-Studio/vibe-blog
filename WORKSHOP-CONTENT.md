# Zero to Vibe Coding Workshop Content
*From learning logs → workshop materials for PMs*

## Core Value Prop
Teaching PMs to build using their existing skills + AI, based on real experience not theory.

## Workshop Modules from Learning Logs

### Module 1: Foundation & Getting Unstuck
**Source logs**: vibe-coder-learning-log.md, collab-coding-discovery.md

**Key Topics:**
- The 30-minute terror (terminal/Git/VS Code setup)
- Git as save points (Final Fantasy mental model)
- Local vs production (kitchen/restaurant metaphor)
- Breaking things teaches faster
- Permission to be confused

**PM Angle:**
- Setup is harder than coding
- Your planning skills actually help here
- Small wins matter

**Hands-on:**
- Terminal basics without crying
- First Git commit celebration
- Deploy something live in 10 minutes

### Module 2: AI That Actually Helps
**Source logs**: anti-agreeable-ai-toolkit.md, claude-md-optimization-log.md

**The Anti-Agreeable Toolkit (7 prompts):**
1. Critical evaluation requests
2. Certainty tagging [High confidence] vs [Speculation]
3. Pre-mortem forcing
4. "What will break first?" questions
5. Alternative approaches demanding
6. Time/resource reality checks
7. "Insult my idea productively"

**Two-Tool Workflow:**
- Claude Desktop for strategy
- Claude Code for execution
- When to switch contexts

**Claude.md Evolution:**
- 100 lines → 10 lines
- One document, one purpose
- Context that actually helps

**Hands-on:**
- Set up Claude tools properly
- Write your first Claude.md
- Practice anti-agreeable prompting

### Module 3: Product Thinking in Code
**Source logs**: context-engineering-guide.md, review-site-strategy-log.md

**PM Superpowers:**
- PRD → Product in 10 minutes story
- Pre-mortems that save projects
- Strategy validation through building
- Assembly line vs superhero thinking

**Context Engineering:**
- The sandwich method
- Architecture > clever prompts
- Token limits as features
- Separation of concerns

**Hands-on:**
- Build something from a PRD
- Run a pre-mortem on your idea
- Design context architecture

### Module 4: Scaling & Systems (Advanced)
**Source logs**: multi-agent-learning-log.md, well-regarded-pipeline-log.md

**Multi-Agent Patterns:**
- 6-project content pipeline
- Authority → investigation → synthesis
- Specialized vs generalized Claude

**Content at Scale:**
- 100 posts without sounding robotic
- Systematic variety preservation
- Research verification pipeline

**Hands-on:**
- Design a multi-agent workflow
- Build a content pipeline
- Ship something substantial

### PM-Specific Wins
- "Better than writing a strat doc"
- Strategy skills that transfer
- Why PMs have advantages
- Product thinking as superpower
