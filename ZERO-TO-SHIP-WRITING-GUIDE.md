# Zero to Ship Article Writing Guide

## Core Voice
Write like you're explaining something to a smart friend who just hasn't learned this yet. They're not dumb, they just need context. You're giving them the industry shortcuts without being condescending or overly clever.

## What TO Do

### Opening Pattern
Start with the actual problem people face. "Every tutorial assumes you already have a 'project directory'" is good because it's the exact moment of confusion. Jump right into the disconnect between what tutorials assume and what beginners actually know.

### Industry Context
Give quick "this is how developers do it" context without making it seem mystical. "Quick context: developers keep all their code in one place" - simple, factual, demystifying. Explain the why briefly - it keeps machines clean, makes backups easier, you always know where stuff is.

### Instructions
Clear, simple commands with minimal explanation. Show the exact commands, then explain what just happened in plain language. "Now you have `~/dev` as your home base" - straightforward confirmation of what they accomplished.

### Future State
Paint a picture of how they'll use this. "Each project will get its own folder in here" helps them see the pattern. Connect it to their workflow with Claude. Make it concrete.

## What NOT to Do

### Banned Phrases and Patterns
- "Here's what they're not telling you"
- "Question? Answer" format
- "The one [thing] to rule them all"
- "Stop [doing X], start [doing Y]"
- "That's it. That's the [thing]"
- Any "reality check" sections
- Designer/PM takes as separate sections
- Forced 6-part structure

### Avoid Trying Too Hard
- No forced wit or cleverness
- No cursing to sound edgy
- No excessive metaphors
- No Figma references (they get repetitive)
- No "psychopath" or extreme characterizations

### Skip the Fluff
- Don't over-explain simple concepts
- Don't add sections just to have sections
- Don't force personality where it doesn't fit naturally
- Don't make everything a grand revelation

## Tone Guidelines

### Keep It Conversational
Write how you'd actually explain it to someone. Not formal documentation, not a comedy routine. Just clear explanation with occasional natural personality.

### Industry Insider Without Gatekeeping
Share the "everyone does it this way" knowledge without making it seem exclusive. You're bringing them into the loop, not showing off that you're already in it.

### Practical Over Philosophical
Focus on what they need to do and why it works. Save the deep thoughts for posts that specifically explore concepts.

## Structure Approach

### Natural Flow, Not Template
Let each article find its own structure based on the content. Some might need more context, others might be mostly instructions. Don't force every article into the same shape.

### Length as Needed
Some concepts need 200 words, others need 800. Write until you've explained it clearly, then stop. No padding, no artificial brevity.

### Concrete Examples
When explaining conventions, show the variations. "Usually `~/dev` or `~/projects`. Some people use `~/code`" gives them the pattern without being prescriptive.

## Remember
You're writing for product and design people who want to build. They're smart, they're motivated, they just need someone to fill in the gaps that every tutorial skips. Be that friend who actually explains the basics without making them feel basic.
