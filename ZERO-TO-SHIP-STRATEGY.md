# Zero to Ship Content Strategy

## Core Concept
Get non-technical people (PMs, designers) from zero knowledge to a working local HTML site they can see in their browser. Bite-sized wins, no fluff, real progress.

## Why Sites, Not Apps (For Now)
- Apps are soufflés, sites are pasta - hard to fuck up pasta
- See results in 5 minutes vs 5 hours  
- No database drama, auth nightmares, or state management
- Still ship something real to the internet
- Build confidence before complexity

## Content Principles

### Bite-Sized Wins
- One article = one specific task = one clear win
- 300-800 words typically (no hard limit, just no fluff)
- Each article builds on previous
- Reader can stop anywhere and still have accomplished something

### Voice & Tone
- Direct, no BS
- "It's OK to be dumb" energy
- Permission to take shortcuts (copy-paste is fine)
- Reality checks on time/difficulty
- Occasional cooking/gaming metaphors
- Humor when natural, never forced

### What We DON'T Do
- Long explanations of theory
- Multiple concepts per article  
- "You should understand this deeply" preaching
- Dev best practices (this is for shipping, not scalability)
- App complexity in phase 1

## Article Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Getting Started)
1. **Terminal Terror to Terminal Courage** ✓ [DONE]
   - Overcoming command line fear
   - Basic navigation commands
   - Reality: Everyone googles terminal commands

2. **Making a Home for Your Code**
   - Creating ~/coding folder structure  
   - Why organization matters day 1
   - Your projects live here forever

3. **The One Thing to Install First**
   - Just Homebrew, nothing else
   - Copy-paste commands that work
   - Permission errors are normal

4. **Claude Code: Your Coding Copilot**  
   - Why this tool (ignore the weekly drops)
   - Downloading and opening
   - Your first session

5. **Teaching Claude About Your Project**
   - Creating CLAUDE.md file
   - What to include (and what not to)
   - This is Claude's instruction manual

### Phase 2: Building (Make Something)
6. **HTML in 60 Seconds**
   - One prompt for index.html
   - Opening in browser
   - You just shipped locally

7. **CSS: Making It Not Ugly**
   - Claude as interior designer
   - Change colors, fonts, spacing
   - Still don't need to understand CSS

8. **Breaking Things to Learn**
   - Inspect element superpower
   - Change stuff, see what happens
   - Can't break anything permanently

9. **Images and Real Content**
   - Goodbye lorem ipsum
   - Adding your images
   - Making it yours

### Phase 3: Leveling Up (Dev Workflow)
10. **Live Reload Magic**
    - Simple dev server setup
    - See changes without refreshing
    - Feel like a real developer

11. **Git: Save Your Ass, Save Your Work**
    - Three commands only
    - Your safety net
    - First commit screenshot

12. **Components: Copy Once, Use Everywhere**
    - Reusable pieces
    - Navigation that updates everywhere
    - Work smarter not harder

### Phase 4: Ship It (Go Live)
13. **Picking Your Ship: Vercel vs Netlify**
    - They're the same, pick one
    - 5 minute setup
    - Free tier is plenty

14. **Domain Names: Your Home on the Internet**
    - Buying your first domain
    - Connecting to your site
    - You're officially live

15. **The Victory Lap**
    - What you built
    - What you actually learned  
    - Where to go from here

## Future Phases (Not Yet)

### Phase 5: Apps Path
- Node.js and npm
- React/Next.js basics
- Database connections
- User authentication
- Deployment complexity

### Phase 6: Production Ready
- Error handling
- Performance
- Security basics
- Monitoring
- Scaling

## Success Metrics
- Reader completes at least 3 articles
- Reader has working local HTML site
- Reader feels confident to continue
- Reader doesn't feel overwhelmed
- Reader actually ships something live

## What Each Article Must Have
1. **Clear win** - What they'll accomplish
2. **Single focus** - One thing only
3. **Reality check** - Time/difficulty honesty
4. **Copy-pasteable** - Commands that work
5. **Screenshot** - Visual proof of progress
6. **Next step** - Where to go after

## Module Structure on Zero to Ship Page

### Visual Design
- Numbered lessons (1.1, 1.2, etc)
- Clear phases/modules
- Progress feel as they go down
- Links to actual articles when ready
- Greyed out future articles (coming soon)

### Module Descriptions
Keep short, focus on outcome:
- "Foundation: Get your computer ready"
- "Building: Make your first site"
- "Leveling Up: Work like a developer"
- "Ship It: Go live on the internet"

## Content Creation Priority
1. Write articles 2-5 to complete Foundation
2. Write Building phase (6-9)
3. Test with real users
4. Adjust based on where they get stuck
5. Complete remaining phases

## What Success Looks Like
Someone with zero coding knowledge:
- Has Claude Code running
- Built a basic HTML/CSS site
- Pushed it live to the internet
- Feels confident to keep learning
- Didn't quit from overwhelm
